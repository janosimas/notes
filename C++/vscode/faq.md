## Duplicated errors

  The most probable cause is two conflicting extensions, check if you don't have more then one extension providing the same information.

  Common extensions that provide duplicate error/warning messages `C++ Microsoft`, `Clangd` and `Flylint`.

  `Cppcheck` may give the same warnings but I would not classify as duplicate as it is a different kind of analysis.
