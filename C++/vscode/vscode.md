# VSCode for C++ prototyping

<details>
<summary> Installation </summary>

  [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) can be installed in 3 different ways: in the user folder (recomended by **Microsoft**), system wide or [portable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable).

  Each installation mode has it's advantages, if you have a very specific need and always uses **VSCode** for the same function, go with the user folder installation.

  In case you develop with more then one language or has other needs, like Docker or database management, go with portable installation.
  The portable installation allows you to keep your extensions independent and avoid having too many extensions.

  Too many extensions can lag your **VSCode** and are very hard to manage.

<summary> C++ </summary>

  - [C/C++ (Microsoft)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

  The **Microsoft** extension is the minimum one need to use C++.
  It works fairly well but you'll need some work to set it up properly for anything more than a "folder project".

  In **Windows** you may also need to configure the compiler path for different architectures.

  - [Clangd (LLVM)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)

  The official **LLVM** extension for **clangd** provides alternatives and extra tools for the Microsoft one.

  The extesion can be set up by:
  1. *compile_commands.json*
      - Can be generated by *CMake* or *Visual Studio*
  2. manual configuration
      - Easy for the simple case
      - Complex with a lot of files for anything else

  - [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)

  Simple extension for building and executing a single file. Works with a lot of languages out of the box, with C++ you may need to tweak a little the command.
